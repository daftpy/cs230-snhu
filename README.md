# The Gaming Room Journal

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room had a successful multiplayer Android game called, Draw It Or Lose It. To reach a wider audience, the Gaming Room hired Create Technology Solutions to develop a web-based game that will serve multiple platforms. To help help accomplish this task, I assembled a Software Design Document to help guide the design and production of a resilient and robust platform to serve such a game. 

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

I believe this document best highlights the advantages a development team gains by leveraging open source solutions. The recommendation made for a Linux based operating system for the web platform can lead to savings on license fees, as well as the ability to utilize other open source software libraries to provide free solutions to problems that arise throughout development.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having the design document serve as a blueprint throughout the development process helped me maintain a focus on the client’s needs. Having a design document with constraints provided structure to the project and a method to approach building the game.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

After review I would restructure the platform comparisons to be more clear and offer a more congruent comparison. I did cover the adequate points, but writing in the table was difficult and I could make those sections easier to read while offering a more precise comparison.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Making sure you understand and fulfill the users needs is critical when building software for a client. I used my current knowledge of web games and understood the clients need to reach a broader audience with an accessible platform that could serve a diverse set of users. Understanding the nature of the high quality images used in the game and real time rendering is also critical for building the client a platform that will perform as they expect.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I used a systematic approach, starting with analysis of the architecture requirements and followed an iterative development process. The design document served as a framework or guide to inform the development of a game that would meet the clients needs. Future strategies might include use case scenarios, focus groups, and beta testing of the game. Incorporating user feedback would also be a crucial step in any client based project to ensure our game is not only technically correct, but also user friendly.
